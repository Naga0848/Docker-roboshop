# Below are the steps in understanding the CMD instruction step-by-step

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
is the default command that gets executed when a container is started from the image you're building.

🧠 What CMD Does
It tells Docker: “When someone runs a container from this image, execute node server.js.”

This starts your Node.js application by running the server.js file.


=============

the word node refers to the Node.js runtime—a JavaScript engine that lets you run JavaScript code outside of a browser, typically on servers.

🧠 What node Does Here
It launches the Node.js interpreter.

It runs the file server.js, which is presumably your backend application or server logic.

So when the container starts, it’s essentially doing:

node server.js
inside the container, which kicks off your app

============

Your Dockerfile starts with:


FROM node:20
This means your image is based on the official Node.js version 20 image, which already includes the node command. So you don’t need to install Node.js manually—it’s baked into the image.

If you want, I can help you verify that server.js is set up correctly to start your app, or walk through how to expose ports and connect it to MongoDB. Just say the word.
